          <h2>How did I get here?</h2>
            <p id="bio">My fondest memories all share one focus: the ability for me to tell stories through tangible experiences.  My childhood consisted of carrying around sketchbooks, markers, paint, beads, string.  Anything that I could get my hands on to create something (anything), I chased after it.  It didn’t end there, and I was restless in my approach.  When my friends came over, I would create complex games and stories from the ground up, mulling over every detail and rule in the hopes of creating the best game ever.</p>
            <p id="bio2">Though my passion for storytelling never ended there, I became bogged down by the demands of growing older.  Being part of an immigrant family has always been a huge part of my identity because it dictated so many of the choices I made my whole life.  One decision I made was pursuing a degree in a more “traditional” industry -- premedicine and health.  I was drawn to the ability to help others, while making decisions based on research and precision.  However, the very core of my being never stopped yearning for something more creative.  Was there anything out there for me that would allow me to do both?
            After many years of searching for answers, I finally discovered design through a series of happy coincidences.  From the get go, I knew that design was the answer I had been seeking for all these years.</p>
            <p id="bio3"><strong><span><b>Design allows me to choose all of the things I love.</b></span></strong></p>
            <p id="bio4">Though I found myself on a long-winded road, I’m grateful for every discovery I’ve made along the way.  My many years of schooling filled with scientific methodology and research helped unlock my abillity to determine solutions based on data and precision.  My work in healthcare presented me with the keen ability to drive tangible impact through empathic listening and understanding.  My passion of visual arts sharpened my ability to create beautiful interfaces and visual delights.</p>
            <p id="bio5">If you share a similar enthusiasm and passion, or would like to add more of this to your team, please feel free to drop me a line!</p>
